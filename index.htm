    <h2>Why Choose Globally Secure IT</h2>

    <p class="section-intro">
      Globally Secure IT delivers executive-level cybersecurity leadership
      designed to align security strategy with business outcomes. We help
      organizations reduce risk, optimize spend, and build security programs
      that scale with the business — not against it.
    </p>

    <div class="features">
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Business-Driven Security</h3>
        <p>
          We translate cybersecurity into the language executives and boards
          understand — risk, impact, and return on investment. Security becomes
          an enabler, not a blocker.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Proven Financial Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Our engagements routinely uncover redundant tooling, misaligned
          controls, and inefficiencies — delivering measurable savings and
          documented risk reduction.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Deep Enterprise Experience</h3>
        <p>
          With decades of experience across Fortune 500 companies, global
          enterprises, and federal agencies, we bring practical solutions — not
          theoretical frameworks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>Framework-Aligned, Outcome-Focused</h3>
        <p>
          We operationalize NIST, ISO 27001, COBIT, HIPAA, and Zero Trust in ways
          that support real business workflows and audit readiness.
