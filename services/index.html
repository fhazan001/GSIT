This process prevents costly post-acquisition surprises like data breaches and regulatory fines by focusing on the security posture, compliance status, and breach history. The findings inform negotiations and help plan a secure integration. <b>Ensure your next M&A deal is secure. Contact us today</b> to perform a comprehensive security due diligence assessment and protect your investment from hidden cyber risks and liabilities.
